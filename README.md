Insecure-Guestbook
==================
This is a guestbook written in PHP that stores names in a MySQL database.
It is intentionally made insecure so that I can use it for examples of
SQL injection. This was made for a research essay I wrote for a 
Computer Networks course.

You can see it in action [here](http://sql.mulatti.ca).
